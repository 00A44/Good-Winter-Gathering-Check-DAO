<h1 align="center">Welcome to Good Winter Gathering Check</h1>
<h1 align="center">良い冬の集まりチェック</h1>
<h3 align="center">Good Winter Gathering Check is a future Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that will benefit creatives tremendously. Any and all are welcome and the DAO functions much the same way a guild does. I hope to have employment and payroll through cryptocurrencies.</h3>

<h3 align="center">Please join the Guilded server that I have set up temporarily. I will have a private IRC channel further down the road. I was perma banned off discord a while ago even though I didn’t do anything. Guilded is a popular alternative to Discord. Only a Username and Password is required. Private message me and add me as a friend. Also, contribute to the discussion by posting on Guilded. Thank you.
</h3>

Users in countries with current conflicts e.g. (Russia, North Korea) are not permitted to create new DAOs, but I welcome them to build their own along side mine. You are more than welcome to fork my repos. Anything related to politics and talking about “Js” will get you banned. As much as I don’t care about moderation, the Guilded server, YouTube channel, and Github repo will get removed off the Internet by violating the TOS. Please...only discuss building the DOA and getting these projects moved to in-house servers.
